# Binary Search

## The problem

Write a function `f(N, M)` that accepts a number array N and a key M and return true if the key is present in the array and false if it is not.
- use recursion

## Concepts
- Recursion
  - a function calling itself
  - must have a *base case* that returns a value instead of calling itself again
- values being searched must be sorted

## Note
- very popular and common algorithm due to O(log n) complexity
