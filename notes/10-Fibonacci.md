# Fibonacci

## The problem

Write a function `f(N)` that returns the Nth member of the Fibonacci sequence.
- use recursion

## Concepts
- Recursion

## Notes
- can be done in very little code
- the recursion base case relies on first two numbers being 1 and 1
- the solution has O (2^n) complexity - better solution in next lesion
