# ReverseWords

## The problem

Write a function `f(N)` that accepts a string, reverses every word in that string and returns the modified string.
- reverse every word, but not the string itself
- do not use array.reverse()

## Concepts
- use what you've learned so far

### Note:
- implemet it by yourself before watching
