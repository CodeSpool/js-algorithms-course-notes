# Reverse array in place

## The problem

Write a function `f(N)` that accepts an array and returns that array reversed
- do not use array.reverse()
- do not create new array variable

## Concepts
- using a temporary placeholder variable
- array traversal

## Note
- note that you should only traverse half ot the array: `; i < arr.length / 2` because by that time all elements are switched.
