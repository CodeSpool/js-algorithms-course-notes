# BubbleSort

## The problem

Write a function `f(N)` that accepts an array of numbers N and returns it sorted

## Concepts
- compare each member to the element to the right
- if right number is larger, switch the two elements
- each pass there is no need to check (length - i)th element, as that is the largest num in the last pass (largest elements 'bubble' up to the end)
- length - 1 passes are needed to fully sort the array

## Notes
