# FizzBuzz

## The problem

Write a function `f(N)` that logs out numbers from 0 to N, but replacing:
- numbers divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz"
- numbers divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz"
- numbers divisible by 15 with the word "FizzBuzz"

## Concepts

### Modulus
 - returns remainder of a division
 - `%` operator
 - eg: `7 % 3 = 1`

### Note:
Not the best solution performance-wise
